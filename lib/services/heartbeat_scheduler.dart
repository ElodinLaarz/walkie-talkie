/// Drives the protocol's `ping`/heartbeat plane: emits an [onTick] every
/// [pingInterval] so the caller can send a `Heartbeat` over the wire, and
/// declares a peer "lost" when no `notePingFrom` has arrived for that peer
/// within [missThreshold].
///
/// The scheduler is **role-agnostic**. The cubit owns the host-vs-guest
/// distinction: on the host side a lost peer means "drop from roster +
/// broadcast a `RosterUpdate`"; on the guest side it means "the host went
/// silent → start the reconnect loop". The scheduler just signals.
///
/// Per [docs/protocol.md] §"Health":
///   * `pingInterval` defaults to 5 s.
///   * `missThreshold` defaults to 15 s — three consecutive missed pings.
///
/// **Lifecycle.** [start] must be called when the room is entered and
/// [stop] when it's left. [start] is idempotent: calling it twice cancels
/// the prior timer first, so callers don't need to guard against double-start.
///
/// **`lastSeen` semantics.** A peer is only tracked once they've sent at
/// least one ping (or other inbound activity routed through
/// [notePingFrom]). A peer that never pings is never declared lost — that
/// failure mode belongs to a different layer (transport-level disconnect).
